# SD card raw example

Read SD cards on Pico. Compatible with Maker Pico out of the box.

Use spi interface ("spi1") as follows:
```
SCK  GP10
MOSI GP11
MISO GP12
CS   GP15
```

Limitations:
* file systems not supported, only raw data
* read, but not write, blocks
* single-block read, not multiblock
* version 2 cards supported, not version 1
* hard-coded spi pins


## Speed

On a single test, reading a block of 512 bytes took almost exactly 25ms
on a spi speed of 200kHz. A transfer of 8kb would therefore take
391ms (=25 * 8000/512). 
So mono 8-bit sound would seem doable at that rate.


At 400kHz took 17ms, implying 8k transfer takes 265ms. So, a 2X speedup in rate
takes 68% of the time. i.e. less than 2X speedup in actual transfer rate.

At 600kHz, 512b took 13ms.

At 1MHz, 512b took 9.6ms. (initialisation was at 100kHz, though). Better!

 
## Sundry notes

When working with interrupts, I found that the use of volatile variables was necessary.
